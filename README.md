# citycot-Hub-projects
Welcome to my project repository! These are the projects I made during the Front-End Bootcamp at Citycot Innovation Hub. The bootcamp was both challenging and exciting. I learned a lot about front-end development, including:
1.HTML: Creating the structure of web pages
2.CSS: Making web pages look nice
3.JavaScript: Adding features and interactions
4.Bootstrap: Making pages work well on all devices
Projects
This repository contains the projects I worked on during the bootcamp. Each project shows the skills I learned. Feel free to look at the code!
Thanks
A big thank you to the Citycot Innovation Hub team for their help and support.
